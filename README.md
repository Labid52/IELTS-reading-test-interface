* **Text and Note Highlighting**: Users can highlight text and add notes for later reference.
* **Dynamic Content Loading**: The ability to load content dynamically into the interface.
* **Question Navigation**: A system for managing navigation between different questions or sections.
* **Saving and Loading**: Users can save their answers and notes in local storage and retrieve them later.
